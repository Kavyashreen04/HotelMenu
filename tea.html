    <h3>COFFEE</h3>
    <h4>Espresso (Short Black)</h4>
    <p>The espresso (aka “short black”) is the foundation and the most important part to every espresso based drink. So much so that we’ve written a guide on how to make the perfect espresso shot. But for this post we are keeping it simple.</p>

    <h4>Double Espresso (Doppio)</h4>
    <p>A double espresso (aka “Doppio”) is just that -- two espresso shots in one cup. </p>

    <h4>Short Macchiato</h4>
    <p>A short macchiato is similar to an espresso but with a dollop of steamed milk and foam to mellow the harsh taste of an espresso. You will find that baristas in different countries make short macchiatos differently. But the traditional way of making a short macchiato is as follows.</p>

    <h4>Long Macchiato</h4>
    <p>A long macchiato is the same as a short macchiato but with a double shot of espresso. The same rule of thirds applies in the traditionally made long macchiato.</p>

    <h4>Ristretto</h4>
    <p>A ristretto is an espresso shot that is extracted with the same amount of coffee but half the amount of water. The end result is a more concentrated and darker espresso extraction. </p>

    <h4>Mocha</h4>
    <p>A mocha is a mix between a cappuccino and a hot chocolate. It is made by putting mixing chocolate powder with an espresso shot and then adding steamed milk and micro-foam into the beverage. </p>
